## 📥 Download

**[⬇️ Download Latest Release](https://github.com/HJS-cpu/CopyBasket/releases/latest)**

## 🔧 Installation

### Using the Installer (recommended)

1. Download **`CopyBasket-X.Y.Z-setup.exe`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/HJS-cpu/CopyBasket/releases/latest).
2. Run the installer — it will request admin rights, install the correct DLL (x64/x86), and register the shell extension automatically.
3. To uninstall, use "Programs and Features" in Control Panel.

### Using CB-CMT (portable)

1. Download **`CopyBasket_vX.Y.Z.zip`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/HJS-cpu/CopyBasket/releases/latest).
2. Extract `CopyBasket_x64.dll` (or `_x86.dll`) and `CB-CMT.exe` to the same folder (e.g. `C:\Program Files\CopyBasket\`).
3. Run **CB-CMT.exe** — it will prompt for elevation and let you activate or deactivate the context menu with one click.

### Manual (regsvr32)

```cmd
regsvr32 "C:\Program Files\CopyBasket\CopyBasket.dll"
```

To unregister:

```cmd
regsvr32 /u "C:\Program Files\CopyBasket\CopyBasket.dll"
```

## 📋 Context Menu

Right-click any file, folder, or the folder background to access the **CopyBasket** submenu:

| Item | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Add to Basket** | Add selected files/folders to the basket |
| **Copy Path** | Copy selected paths to the clipboard |
| **Show Basket (N files)** | Open the basket viewer dialog |
| **Copy Basket Here** | Copy basket contents to the current folder |
| **Copy to...** | Choose a folder, then copy |
| **Move Basket Here** | Move basket contents to the current folder |
| **Move to...** | Choose a folder, then move |
| **Clear Basket** | Remove all items from the basket |
| **Settings** | Change language (German / English) |

Items are grayed out when the basket is empty. "Add to Basket" and "Copy Path" are hidden on background clicks.

## 🛠️ Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools (Toolset v143)
- Windows SDK

### Build

```bash
# Shell Extension (x64 + x86)
MSBuild.exe CopyBasket.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
MSBuild.exe CopyBasket.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=Win32

# Registration Tool (x64)
MSBuild.exe "regsvr Tool\CopyBasketContextMenu.sln" /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
```

Output:
- `x64\Release\CopyBasket.dll` / `Release\CopyBasket.dll`
- `regsvr Tool\bin\Release\CB-CMT.exe`

## ⚙️ How It Works

CopyBasket is a COM DLL implementing `IShellExtInit` and `IContextMenu`. It registers as a context menu handler for files, directories, and the directory background.

- **Basket Storage:** `%APPDATA%\CopyBasket\basket.txt` (UTF-16LE with BOM)
- **Incident Log:** `%APPDATA%\CopyBasket\operations.log` (rewritten per incident, only on abort/partial failure)
- **File Operations:** `IFileOperation` with `CFileOperationProgressSink` on a background thread (`_beginthreadex`)
- **Reliable Logging:** Pre-scan + post-check via filesystem verification — works for deeply nested directory trees regardless of IFileOperation callback behaviour
- **Icons:** Shared Windows system image list via `SHGetFileInfoW(SHGFI_SYSICONINDEX)` attached to both ListView and TreeView
- **Settings:** Language preference stored in `HKCU\Software\CopyBasket`
- **Dialog Persistence:** Window size, column widths, and split ratio saved in Registry

## 📝 Changelog

### v1.4.0
- **Basket dialog: TreeView detail panel** — shows the full recursive contents of the selected basket entry (folders and all nested files), read-only
- **Resizable splitter** between ListView and TreeView, with min-pane constraints; split ratio persisted in Registry (`SplitRatio`)
- **Native Windows system icons** in both ListView and TreeView — shared `SHGetFileInfoW` image list, matches Explorer's icons exactly (folders, `.txt`, `.exe`, custom app icons, etc.)
- **New "Type" column** in the basket ListView between Name and Path (shows "File" / "Folder"), with its own persisted width (`ColWidth2`)
- **Incident log for aborted / failed operations:**
  - Detailed log written to `%APPDATA%\CopyBasket\operations.log` (UTF-16LE, rewritten per incident)
  - Pre-scan + filesystem post-check — reliable even when moving deeply nested directory trees across volumes
  - `TaskDialogIndirect` notification with **"Open Log"** button showing how many files were not processed
  - Log is silent during normal operations; only appears when something actually went wrong

### v1.3.0
- Migrated file operations from `SHFileOperationW` to modern `IFileOperation` API with `CFileOperationProgressSink`
